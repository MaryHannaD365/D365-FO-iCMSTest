# Synchronize products in Finance and Operations to products in Field Service

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic discusses the templates and underlying task that are used to synchronize products from Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Field Service.

The used **Field Service Products (Fin and Ops to Field Service)** template is based on the **Products (Fin and Ops to Sales) – Direct** template from Prospect to Cash. For more information, see [Products (Fin and Ops to Sales) – Direct](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/supply-chain/sales-marketing/products-template-mapping-direct).

This topic only describes the differences between the **Field Service Products (Fin and Ops to Field Service)** and **Products (Fin and Ops to Sales) – Direct** templates.

## Templates and tasks

**Name of the template in Data integration:**

- Field Service Products (Fin and Ops to Field Service)

**Name of the task in the Data integration project:**

- Products - Products

The **Field Service Products (Fin and Ops to Field Service)** template includes one mapping that isn't included in the **Products (Fin and Ops to Sales) – Direct** template. This mapping ensures that the required Field Service-specific field **Service Product Type** is set correctly.

```
FIELDSERVICEPRODUCTTYPE        Fn        msdyn_fieldserciveproducttype
```

The following value mapping is used.

```
inventory     :  690970000
nonInventory  :  690970001 
service       :  690970002 
```

In Finance and Operations, the **Field Service product type** value on the **Sellable released products** data entity is calculated as follows:

- **Inventory:** Product type = Product and Item model group, Stocked product = True
- **NonInventory:** Product type = Product and Item model group, Stocked product = False
- **Service:** Product type = Service

## Template mapping in Data integration

The following illustrations show the template mapping in Data integration.
