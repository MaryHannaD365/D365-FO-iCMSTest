To use the Support tool, you must have previously created a project in Lifecycle Services (LCS) and installed and ran the System diagnostics in your environment. For more information, see [System diagnostics (Lifecycle Services, LCS)](ax-2012/system-diagnostics-lcs.md).


## Open a new incident
1. In LCS, navigate to the project for which you want to file a support incident. 

2. Click the **Support** tile.
   ![Support menu](media/CPS1.png)

6. In the **Describe your issue** window, enter the following:

   - Select **Yes** if the issue occured in an environment. Select the environment name.  
   - Enter a short description of your issue in the **Title** field.
   - Provide details about the issue detail and the steps needed to reproduce the error.
   - If applicable, enter an error message. 
   - If possible, attach screenshots that illustrate the problem. To do this, click **Attach file from computer**.
 
   > [!NOTE]
   > When you create an incident, Issue search will populate the top 10 "Possible issue solutions" search results based on the your selection and input, and dynamically refresh these results as more details are provided during support case creation. 
   > 
   > Standalone Issue search is still accessible via the dropdown menu if you need to search for more solutions.

8. Select the support contract and the severity level. 
    
   - Support contracts for on-premises environments have a limited incident count. 
   - Support contracts for cloud environments have an unlimited incident count. 
   - For on-premises products or cloud environments, from the list of available support contracts, select the support option to use if you have multiple tier support contracts.

### Remove a Premier support plan 
If you need to remove a Premier support plan from one or more of your contracts, you can do so using the Premier Portal.
1. Log in to the [Premier Portal](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/premier/access).
2. Select the contracts you want to remove from the **Accociated access IDs**, and then click **Remove**. 
   
   
## Report production outage
Report production outage provides a quick and effective channel to escalate  issues to Microsoft Support in the event that the services in a production environment are degraded or become unavailable.  

This feature is available to all customers that have purchased Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations and have **implementation** projects with a **production** environment deployed in LCS.  

A production outage is defined as **one or more system-wide issues on a live production environment that impact multiple users and prevent your business from performing daily operations**. 

**Reporting flow**
1. In a live production environment, a customer experiences an outage or other situation that prevents business from continuing.
2. The customer reports a production outage issue by using the LCS Support portal.
3. The customer selects a production outage issue and provides additional information.
4. A Microsoft support engineer acknowledges the production outage ticket within 30 minutes of submission and begins to immediately collaborate with stakeholders to investigate and resolve the issue.
5. A support engineer contacts the customer to provide a status update

**Access and availibility**

All users that have been added to a customer's implementation project have access to this feature. This includes project owners, organization admins, team members, and environment managers. 

This feature is available to:
- Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operation 
- Environments managed by Microsoft 
- A production environment in the LCS Project 
- All support plans

### Report a production outage
1. Log into your LCS project.
2. From the hamburger menu, click **Support**.

> [!NOTE] 
> If you don't see your situation listed in the outage scenarios, enter a support incident through LCS. If, during the initial investigation by a Microsoft support engineer, it is found the situation does not meet the current list of production outage scenarios, the support incident will be transferred to the correct support team and SLA based on your current support plan.
