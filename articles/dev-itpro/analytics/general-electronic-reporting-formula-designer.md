# Formula designer in Electronic reporting (ER)

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic explains how to use the formula designer in Electronic reporting (ER). When you design a format for a specific electronic document in ER, you can use formulas to transform data so that it meets the requirements for the document's fulfillment and formatting. These formulas resemble formulas in Microsoft Excel. Various types of functions are supported in the formulas: text, date and time, mathematical, logical, information, data type conversion, and other (business domainâ€“specific functions).

## Formula designer overview

ER supports the formula designer. Therefore, at design time, you can configure expressions that can be used for the following tasks at runtime:

- Transform data that is received from a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations database, and that should be entered in an ER data model that is designed to be a data source for ER formats. (For example, these transformations might include filtering, grouping, and data type conversion.)
- Format data that must be sent to a generating electronic document in accordance with the layout and conditions of a specific ER format. (For example, the formatting might be done in accordance with the requested language or culture, or the encoding).
- Control the process of creating electronic documents. (For example, the expressions can enable or disable the output of specific elements of the format, depending on processing data. They can also interrupt the document creation process or throw messages to users.)

You can open the **Formula designer** page when you perform any of the following actions:

- Bind data source items to data model components.
- Bind data source items to format components.
- Complete maintenance of calculated fields that are part of data sources.
- Define the visibility conditions for user input parameters.
- Design a format's transformations.
- Define the enabling conditions for the format's components.
- Define the file names for the format's FILE components.
- Define the conditions for process control validations.
- Define the message text for process control validations.

## Designing ER formulas

### Data binding

The ER formula designer can be used to define an expression that transforms data that is received from data sources, so that the data can be entered in the data consumer at runtime:

- From Finance and Operations data sources and runtime parameters to an ER data model
- From an ER data model to an ER format
- From Finance and Operations data sources and runtime parameters to an ER format

The following illustration shows the design of an expression of this type. In this example, the expression rounds the value of the **Intrastat.AmountMST** field the Intrastat table in Finance and Operations to two decimal places and then returns the rounded value.

[![Data binding](./media/picture-expression-binding.jpg)](./media/picture-expression-binding.jpg)

The following illustration shows how an expression of this type can be used. In this example, the result of the designed expression is entered in the **Transaction.InvoicedAmount** component of the **Tax reporting model** data model.

[![Data binding being used](./media/picture-expression-binding2.jpg)](./media/picture-expression-binding2.jpg)

At runtime, the designed formula, **ROUND (Intrastat.AmountMST, 2)**, rounds the value of the **AmountMST** field for each record in the Intrastat table to two decimal places. It then enters the rounded value in the **Transaction.InvoicedAmount** component of the **Tax reporting** data model.

### Data formatting

The ER formula designer can be used to define an expression that formats data that is received from data sources, so that the data can be sent as part of the generating electronic document. You might have formatting that must be applied as a typical rule that should be reused for a format. In this case, you can introduce that formatting one time in the format configuration, as a named transformation that has a formatting expression. This named transformation can then be linked to many format components where the output must be formatted according to the formatting expression that you created.

The following illustration shows the design of a transformation of this type. In this example, the **TrimmedString** transformation truncates incoming data of the **String** data type by removing leading and trailing spaces. It then returns the truncated string value.

[![Transformation](./media/picture-transformation-design.jpg)](./media/picture-transformation-design.jpg)

The following illustration shows how a transformation of this type can be used. In this example, several format components send text as output to the generating electronic document at runtime. All these format components refer to the **TrimmedString** transformation by name.

[![Transformation being used](./media/picture-transformation-usage.jpg)](./media/picture-transformation-usage.jpg)

When format components, such as the **partyName** component in the preceding illustration, refer to the **TrimmedString** transformation, the transformation sends text as output to the generating electronic document. This text doesn't include leading and trailing spaces.

If you have formatting that must be applied individually, you can introduce that formatting as an individual expression of a binding of a specific format component. The following illustration shows an expression of this type. In this example, the **partyType** format component is bound to the data source via an expression that converts incoming data from the **Model.Company.RegistrationType** field in the data source to uppercase text. The expression then sends that text as output to the electronic document.

### Process flow control

The ER formula designer can be used to define expressions that control the process flow of generating electronic documents. You can perform the following tasks:

- Define conditions that determine when a document creation process must be stopped.
- Specify expressions that either create messages for the user about stopped processes or throw execution log messages about the continuing process of report generation.
- Specify the file names of generating electronic documents, and control the conditions of their creation.

Each rule of the process flow control is designed as an individual validation. The following illustration shows a validation of this type. Here is an explanation of the configuration in this example:

- The validation is evaluated when the **INSTAT** node is created during generation of the XML file.
- If the list of transactions is empty, the validation stops the execution process and returns **FALSE**.
- The validation returns an error message that includes the text of Finance and Operations label SYS70894 in the user's preferred language.

[![Validation](./media/picture-validation.jpg)](./media/picture-validation.jpg)

The ER formula designer can also be used to generate a file name for a generating electronic document and control the file creation process. The following illustration shows the design of a process flow control of this type. Here is an explanation of the configuration in this example:

- The list of records from the **model.Intrastat** data source is divided into batches. Each batch contains up to 1,000 records.
- The output creates a zip file that contains one file in XML format for every batch that was created.
- An expression returns a file name for generating electronic documents by concatenating the file name and the file name extension. For the second batch and all subsequent batches, the file name contains the batch ID as a suffix.
- An expression enables (by returning **TRUE**) the file creation process for batches that contain at least one record.

[![File control](./media/picture-file-control.jpg)](./media/picture-file-control.jpg)

### Basic syntax

ER expressions can contain any or all of the following elements:

- Constants
- Operators
- References
- Paths
- Functions

#### Constants

When you design expressions, you can use text and numeric constants (that is, values that aren't calculated). For example, the expression **VALUE ("100") + 20** uses the numeric constant **20** and the string constant **"100"**, and returns the numeric value **120**. The ER formula designer supports escape sequences. Therefore, you can specify an expression string that should be handled differently. For example, the expression **"Leo Tolstoy ""War and Peace"" Volume 1"** returns the text string **Leo Tolstoy "War and Peace" Volume 1**.

#### Operators

The following table shows the arithmetic operators that you can use to do basic mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

| Operator | Meaning               | Example |
|----------|-----------------------|---------|
| +        | Addition              | 1+2     |
| -        | Subtraction, negation | 5-2, -1 |
| \*       | Multiplication        | 7\*8    |
| /        | Division              | 9/3     |

The following table shows the comparison operators that are supported. You can use these operators to compare two values.

| Operator | Meaning                  | Example    |
|----------|--------------------------|------------|
| =        | Equal                    | X=Y        |
| &gt;     | Greater than             | X&gt;Y     |
| &lt;     | Less than                | X&lt;Y     |
| &gt;=    | Greater than or equal to | X&gt;=Y    |
| &lt;=    | Less than or equal to    | X&lt;=Y    |
| &lt;&gt; | Not equal to             | X&lt;&gt;Y |

Additionally, you can use an ampersand (&) as a text concatenation operator. In this way, you can join, or concatenate, one or more text strings into a single piece of text.

| Operator | Meaning     | Example                                             |
|----------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| &        | Concatenate | "Nothing to print" & ":&nbsp;" & "no records found" |

##### Operator precedence

The order that the parts of a compound expression are evaluated in is important. For example, the result of the expression **1 + 4 / 2** varies, depending on whether the addition operation or the division operation is done first. You can use parentheses to explicitly define how an expression is evaluated. For example, to indicate that the addition operation should be done first, you can change the preceding expression to **(1 + 4) / 2**. If you don't explicitly indicate the order of operations in an expression, the order is based on the default precedence that is assigned to the supported operators. The following table shows the precedence that is assigned to each operator. Operators that have a higher precedence (for example, 7) are evaluated before operators that have a lower precedence (for example, 1).

| Precedence | Operators      | Syntax                                                                  |
|------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 7          | Grouping       | ( â€¦ )                                                                   |
| 6          | Member access  | â€¦ . â€¦                                                                   |
| 5          | Function call  | â€¦ ( â€¦ )                                                                 |
| 4          | Multiplicative | â€¦ \* â€¦<br>â€¦ / â€¦                                                         |
| 3          | Additive       | â€¦ + â€¦<br>â€¦ - â€¦                                                          |
| 2          | Comparison     | â€¦ &lt; â€¦<br>â€¦ &lt;= â€¦<br>â€¦ =&gt; â€¦<br>â€¦ &gt; â€¦<br>â€¦ = â€¦<br>â€¦ &lt;&gt; â€¦ |
| 1          | Separation     | â€¦ , â€¦                                                                   |

If an expression includes multiple consecutive operators that have the same precedence, those operations are evaluated from left to right. For example, the expression **1 + 6 / 2 \* 3 &gt; 5** returns **true**. We recommend that you use parentheses to explicitly indicate the desired order of operations in expressions, so that the expressions are easier to read and maintain.

#### References

All data sources of the current ER component that are available during the design of an expression can be used as named references. (The current ER component can be either a model or a format.) For example, the current ER data model contains the **ReportingDate** data source, and this data source returns a value of the **DATETIME** data type. To correctly format that value in the generating document, you can reference the data source in the expression as **DATETIMEFORMAT (ReportingDate, "dd-MM-yyyy")**.

All characters in the name of a referencing data source that don't represent a letter of the alphabet must be preceded by a single quotation mark ('). If the name of a referencing data source contains at least one symbol that doesn't represent a letter of the alphabet, the name must be enclosed in single quotation marks. (For example, these non-alphabetic symbols can be punctuation marks or other written symbols.) Here are some examples:

- The **Today's date & time** data source must be referred to in an ER expression as **'Today''s date & time'**.
- The **name()** method of the **Customers** data source must be referred to in an ER expression as **Customers.'name()'**.

If the methods of Finance and Operations data sources have parameters, the following syntax is used to call those methods:

- If the **isLanguageRTL** method of the **System** data source has an **EN-US** parameter of the **String** data type, this method must be referred to in an ER expression as **System.'isLanguageRTL'("EN-US")**.
- Quotation marks aren't required when a method name contains only alphanumeric symbols. However, they are required for a method of a table if the name includes brackets.

When the **System** data source is added to an ER mapping that refers to the **Global** Finance and Operations application class, the expression returns the Boolean value **FALSE**. The modified expression **System.' isLanguageRTL'("AR")** returns the Boolean value **TRUE**.

You can limit the way that values are passed to the parameters of this type of method:

- Only constants can be passed to methods of this type. The values of the constants are defined at design time.
- Only primitive (basic) data types are supported for parameters of this type. (The primitive data types are integer, real, Boolean, string, and so on.)

#### Paths

When an expression references a structured data source, you can use the path definition to select a specific primitive element of that data source. A dot character (.) is used to separate individual elements of a structured data source. For example, the current ER data model contains the **InvoiceTransactions** data source, and this data source returns a list of records. The **InvoiceTransactions** record structure contains the **AmountDebit** and **AmountCredit** fields, and both these fields return numeric values. Therefore, you can design the following expression to calculate the invoiced amount: **InvoiceTransactions.AmountDebit - InvoiceTransactions.AmountCredit**.

#### Functions

The next section describes the functions that can be used in ER expressions. All data sources of the expression context (the current ER data model or ER format) can be used as parameters of calling functions, in accordance with the list of arguments for calling functions. Constants can also be used as parameters of calling functions. For example, the current ER data model contains the **InvoiceTransactions** data source, and this data source returns a list of records. The **InvoiceTransactions** record structure contains the **AmountDebit** and **AmountCredit** fields, and both these fields return numeric values. Therefore, to calculate the invoiced amount, you can design the following expression that uses the built-in ER rounding function: **ROUND (InvoiceTransactions.AmountDebit - InvoiceTransactions.AmountCredit, 2)**.

## Supported functions

The following tables describe the data manipulation functions that you can use to design ER data models and ER reports. The list of functions isn't fixed. Developers can extend it. To see the list of functions that you can use, open the functions pane in the ER formula designer.

### Logical functions

| Function | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| CASE (expression, option 1, result 1 \[, option 2, result 2\] â€¦ \[, default result\]) | Evaluate the specified expression value against the specified alternative options. Return the result of the option that equals the value of the expression. Otherwise, return the optional default result, if a default result is specified. (The default result is the last parameter that isn't preceded by an option.) | **CASE( DATETIMEFORMAT( NOW(), "MM"), "10", "WINTER", "11", "WINTER", "12", "WINTER", "")** returns the string **"WINTER"** when the current Finance and Operations session date is between October and December. Otherwise, it returns a blank string. |
| IF (condition, value 1, value 2) | Return the first specified value when the specified condition is met. Otherwise, return the second specified value. If value 1 and value 2 are records or record lists, the result has only the fields that exist in both lists. | **IF (1=2, "condition is met", "condition is not met")** returns the string **"condition is not met"**. |
| NOT (condition) | Return the reversed logical value of the specified condition. | **NOT (TRUE)** returns **FALSE**. |
| AND (condition 1\[, condition 2, â€¦\]) | Return **TRUE** if *all* specified conditions are true. Otherwise, return **FALSE**. | **AND (1=1, "a"="a")** returns **TRUE**. **AND (1=2, "a"="a")** returns **FALSE**. |
| OR (condition 1\[, condition 2, â€¦\]) | Return **FALSE** if *all* specified conditions are false. Return **TRUE** if *any* specified condition is true. | **OR (1=2, "a"="a")** returns **TRUE**. |
| VALUEIN (input, list, list item expression) | Determine whether the specified input matches any value of an item in the specified list. Return **TRUE** if the specified input matches the result of running the specified expression for at least one record. Otherwise, return **FALSE**. The **input** parameter represents the path of a data source element. The value of this element will be matched. The **list** parameter represents the path of a data source element of the record list type as a list of records that contains an expression. The value of this element will be compared with the specified input. The **list item expression** argument represents an expression that either points to or contains a single field of the specified list that should be used for the matching. | For examples, see the [Examples: VALUEIN (input, list, list item expression)](#examples-valuein-input-list-list-item-expression) section that follows. |

#### Examples: VALUEIN (input, list, list item expression)
In general, the **VALUEIN** function is translated to a set of **OR** conditions:

(input = list.item1.value) OR (input = list.item2.value) OR â€¦

##### Example 1
You define the following data source in your model mapping: **List** (**Calculated field** type). This data source contains the expression **SPLIT ("a,b,c", ",")**.

When a data source is called that is configured as the **VALUEIN ("B", List, List.Value)** expression, it returns **TRUE**. In this case, the **VALUEIN** function is translated to the following set of conditions:

**(("B" = "a") or ("B" = "b") or ("B" = "c"))**, where **("B" = "b")** is equal to **TRUE**

When a data source is called that is configured as the **VALUEIN ("B", List, LEFT(List.Value, 0))** expression, it returns **FALSE**. In this case, the **VALUEIN** function is translated to the following condition:

**("B" = "")**, which isn't equal to **TRUE**

Note that the upper limit for the number of characters in the text of such a condition is 32,768 characters. Therefore, you should not create data sources that might exceed this limit at runtime. If the limit is exceeded, the application will stop running, and an exception will be thrown. For example, this situation can occur if the data source is configured as **WHERE (List1, VALUEIN (List1.ID, List2, List2.ID)**, and the **List1** and **List2** lists contain a large volume of records.

In some cases, the **VALUEIN** function is translated to a database statement by using the **EXISTS JOIN** operator. This behavior occurs when the **FILTER** function is used and the following conditions are met:

- The **ASK FOR QUERY** option is turned off for the data source of the **VALUEIN** function that refers to the list of records. (No additional conditions will be applied to this data source at runtime.)
- No nested expressions are configured for the data source of the **VALUEIN** function that refers to the list of records.
- A list item of the **VALUEIN** function refers to a field (not an expression or a method) of the specified data source.

Consider using this option instead of the **WHERE** function as described earlier in this example.

##### Example 2

You define the following data sources in your model mapping:

- **In** (**Table records** type), which refers to the Intrastat table
- **Port** (**Table records** type), which refers to the IntrastatPort table

When a data source is called that is configured as the **FILTER (In, VALUEIN(In.Port, Port, Port.PortId)** expression, the following SQL statement is generated to return filtered records of the Intrastat table:

```
select â€¦ from Intrastat
exists join TableId from IntrastatPort
where IntrastatPort.PortId = Intrastat.Port
```

For **dataAreaId** fields, the final SQL statement is generated by the using **IN** operator.

##### Example 3

You define the following data sources in your model mapping:

- **Le** (**Calculated field** type), which contains the expression **SPLIT ("DEMF,GBSI,USMF", ",")**
- **In** (**Table records** type), which refers to the Intrastat table and for which the **Cross-company** option is turned on

When a data source is called that is configured as the **FILTER (In, VALUEIN (In.dataAreaId, Le, Le.Value)** expression, the final SQL statement contains the following condition:

```
Intrastat.dataAreaId IN ('DEMF', 'GBSI', 'USMF')
```

### Mathematical functions

| ROUND (number, decimals) | Return the specified number after it has been rounded to the specified number of decimal places:<ul><li>If the value of the **decimals** parameter is more than 0 (zero), the specified number is rounded to that many decimal places.</li><li>If the value of the **decimals** parameter is **0** (zero), the specified number is rounded to the nearest integer.</li><li>If the value of the **decimals** parameter is less than 0 (zero), the specified number is rounded to the left of the decimal point.</li></ul> | **ROUND (1200.767, 2)** rounds to two decimal places and returns **1200.77**. **ROUND (1200.767, -3)** rounds to the nearest multiple of 1,000 and returns **1000**. |
| ROUNDDOWN (number, decimals) | Return the specified number after it has been rounded down to the specified number of decimal places.<blockquote>[!NOTE] This function behaves like **ROUND**, but it always rounds the specified number down (toward zero).</blockquote> | **ROUNDDOWN (1200.767, 2)** rounds down to two decimal places and returns **1200.76**. **ROUNDDOWN (1700.767, -3)** rounds down to the nearest multiple of 1,000 and returns **1000**. |
| ROUNDUP (number, decimals) | Return the specified number after it has been rounded up to the specified number of decimal places.<blockquote>[!NOTE] This function behaves like **ROUND**, but it always rounds the specified number up (away from zero).</blockquote> | **ROUNDUP (1200.763, 2)** rounds up to two decimal places and returns **1200.77**. **ROUNDUP (1200.767, -3)** rounds up to the nearest multiple of 1,000 and returns **2000**. |

### Data conversion functions

| Function | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| VALUE (string) | Convert the specified string to a number. Commas and dot characters (.) are considered decimal separators, and a leading hyphen (-) is used as a negative sign. Throw an exception if the specified string contains other non-numeric characters. | **VALUE ("1 234,56")** throws an exception. |
| NUMBERVALUE (string, decimal separator, digit grouping separator) | Convert the specified string to a number. The specified decimal separator is used between the integer and fractional parts of a decimal number. The specified digit grouping separator is used as the thousands separator. | **NUMBERVALUE("1 234,56", ",", " ")** returns **1234.56**. |
| INTVALUE (string) | Return an integer representation of the specified string. Any decimal places are truncated. | **INTVALUE ("100.77")** returns **100**. |
| INTVALUE (number) | Return an integer representation of the specified number. Any decimal places are truncated. | **INTVALUE (-100.77)** returns **-100**. |

### Record functions

| Function | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| NULLCONTAINER (list) | Return a **null** record that has the same structure as the specified record list or record.<blockquote>[!NOTE] This function is obsolete. Use **EMPTYRECORD** instead.</blockquote> | **NULLCONTAINER (SPLIT ("abc", 1))** returns a new empty record that has the same structure as the list that is returned by the **SPLIT** function. |
| EMPTYRECORD (record) | Return a **null** record that has the same structure as the specified record list or record.<blockquote>[!NOTE] A **null** record is a record where all fields have an empty value. An empty value is **0** (zero) for numbers, an empty string for strings, and so on.</blockquote> | **EMPTYRECORD (SPLIT ("abc", 1))** returns a new empty record that has the same structure as the list that is returned by the **SPLIT** function. |
