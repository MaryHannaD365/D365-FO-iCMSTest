# Configure the Warehousing app for on-premises deployments

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to configure Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations - Warehousing for on-premises deployments.

## Prerequisites
The Warehousing app is available on Android and Windows operating systems. To use the app for on-premises deployments, at a minimum, it must be version 1.1.1.0. You must also have one of the following supported versions of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations. Use the information in the following table to evaluate if your hardware and software environment supports the configuration.

| Platform               | Version                                                                            |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Android                | 4.4 and up                                                                         |
| Windows (UWP)          | Windows 10 (all versions)                                                          |
| App version            | 1.1.1.0 and above                                                                  |
| Microsoft Dynamics 365 | Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations platform update 11 (on-premises) |

To be able to reach your on-premises resources with the app, you will need to create DNS records for your AOS and for Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS). For guidance, see [Create DNS zones, and add a record](setup-deploy-on-premises-pu12.md#setup).

## Create an application entry in AD FS
For a successful authentication exchange between AD FS and Finance and Operations, an application entry must be registered in AD FS under an AD FS application group. To create this application entry, run the following Windows PowerShell commands on a machine where the AD FS is installed. The user account must have enough permissions to administer AD FS.

1.  Enter the following command in the Windows PowerShell console to create the application entry  
    
        Add-AdfsClient -Name 'Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations - Warehousing' -ClientId ([guid]::NewGuid()) -ClientType Confidential -GenerateClientSecret -RedirectUri '\<Resource URL\>' -ADUserPrincipalName '\<Admin user\>'Â 

    - The \<Resource URL\> can, for example, be `https://ax.d365ffo.onprem.contoso.com` (where `https://ax.d365ffo.onprem.contoso.com`
is the URL to access Finance and Operations).
    - The \<Admin user\> can be any user with admin access to the AD FS machine.

2.  Save the values that you received.

3.  Run the following command to grant permission to the application.  
    
        Grant-AdfsApplicationPermission -ClientRoleIdentifier '\<Client ID received in previous steps\>' -ServerRoleIdentifier '\<Resource URL\>' -ScopeNames 'openid'

## Create and configure a user account

To enable Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations to use your AD FS application, you must create a user account in Microsoft Dynamics 365 with the same user credentials as the user of the Warehousing app:

1.  Create a user in Finance and Operations and assign the Warehousing mobile
    device user role to the user.

    a.  Go to **System administration** \> **Common** \> **Users**.
    
    b.  Create a new user.
    
    c.  Assign the warehouse mobile device user role, as shown in the example
        screenshot.

2.  Associate your AD FS application with the Warehousing app user.

    a.  In Finance and Operations, click **System administration** \> **Setup** \> **Azure Active Directory applications**.
    
    b.  Create a new line.
    
    c.  Enter the client ID that you obtained when you created an application entry in AD FS (step 2 in "Create an application entry in AD FS"). Enter a name, and select the Warehousing app user.

## Certificates 

Make sure that the devices with the app installed have the right certificates to access the resources. If you are using self-signed certificates, these will need to be installed on each device. For more information, see [Create and export a self-signed
certificate](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff710475(v=ws.10).aspx).

## Configure the application

You must configure the Warehousing app on the device to connect to the Finance and Operations server through the AD FS application.

1.  In the app, open **Connection settings**.
2.  Enter the following information:

    a.  **Active Directory Client ID** - The client ID that you obtained when  you created an application entry in AD FS (step 2 in "Create an application entry in AD FS").

    b.  **Active Directory Client Secret** - The client secret obtained when you created an application entry in AD FS.

    c.  **Active Directory Resource** - The DNS URL for Finance and Operations AOS. Append the URL with '/namespaces/AXSF'. 
        For example: `https://ax.d365ffo.onprem.contoso.com/namespaces/AXSF`

    d.  **Active Directory Tenant** - The DNS URL for Finance and Operations AD FS machine. Append the URL with '/adfs/oauth2'. 
        For example: `https://adfs.d365ffo.onprem.contoso.com/adfs/oauth2`
        Make sure to use the CNAME of the ADFS machine (in the example the CNAME is `https://adfs.d365ffo.onprem.contoso.com`)

3.  **Company** - Enter the legal entity in Finance and Operations to which you want the application to connect.
4.  Select the **Back** button in the top-left corner of the application.

    The application will now connect to your Finance and Operations server and the log-in screen for the warehouse worker will display.
