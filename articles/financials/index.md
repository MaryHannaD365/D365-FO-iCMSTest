## Additional resources

### Blogs

You can find opinions, news, and other information about Accounts payable and other solutions on the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 blog](https://community.dynamics.com/b/msftdynamicsblog?c=Enterprise).

There are many posts about financial management on the [Microsoft Dynamics AX product team blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dax/). Although some of these posts were written for an older version of the product, the same concepts still apply, and the procedures are also similar in the current version.

The [Microsoft Dynamics Operations Partner Community Blog](https://community.dynamics.com/partner/b/operationspartnercommunityblog) gives Microsoft Dynamics Partners a single resource where they can learn what is new and trending in MBS Operations.
