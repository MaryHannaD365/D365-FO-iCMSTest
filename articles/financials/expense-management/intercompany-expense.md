# Intercompany expenses

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

A worker who is employed by one legal entity in an organization might perform work for another legal entity in the same organization. 
In this situation, you can use the intercompany expense feature to assign the worker’s expenses to the legal entity for which the 
work was performed. The legal entity that employs the worker is called the loaning legal entity. The legal entity for which the worker 
incurs expenses is called the borrowing legal entity. 

Before a worker can create and submit expenses for work that is performed for a different legal entity, in the loaning legal entity, 
on the **Expense management parameters** page, select the **Allow intercompany expense lines** option.
