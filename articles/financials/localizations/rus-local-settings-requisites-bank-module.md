[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Before working in the **Bank management** workspace, you should complete the following procedures to ensure that you have the prerequisites needed for setting up bank accounts for Russia.

## Enter bank group information

1. Go to **Cash and bank management > Setup > Bank groups** and click **Update bank accounts**.
2. Select a bank group. 
2. Enter Russia-specific information for the bank group.  
   - **BIC** – Bank identifification code 
   - **Corr. Bank account** – Corresponding bank account
   - **Bank type** – Select either **Main**, **Foreign**, or **Branch**. If you select, **Foreign**, select a **Vendor account** on the **General** FastTab. If you select **Branch**, select a value in the **Main bank** field.
3. (Optional) Select the .docx template to use in the **Payment order in currency** field on the **Setup** FastTab. If defined, this will be the default template for the payment order in currency for all foreign bank accounts related to this bank.

> [!NOTE]
> Before defining a document template, create the templates as files and attach them to the record. You can determine if a document is attached by using the number indicator on the **Document attachment** icon.
