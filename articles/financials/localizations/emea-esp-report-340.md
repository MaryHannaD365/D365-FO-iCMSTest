# Report 340

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Report 340 replaced two earlier reports (Sales Statutory Books and Purchases Statutory Books) that all Spanish companies submitted as hard copies to the Spanish tax authorities. The new report can be uploaded to the tax authorities' website, or it can be submitted by using a software package that is available free of cost from the tax authorities.

Report 340 contains information about all invoices and taxes that are related to invoices that a company issued or received during a specific period. Report 340 should be submitted to the tax authorities during the first 20 days after the reporting period. The reporting period can be a month or a quarter, depending on the size of the company.

## Entries that are included in Report 340

Report 340 includes the following entries:

- **Sales entries** – Entries of value-added tax (VAT) report lines that correspond to sales invoices and project invoices. These records are **Type 2** issued invoices.
- **Sales credit memos (corrective invoices)** – Entries of VAT report lines that correspond to corrective invoices.
- **Purchase entries** – Entries of VAT report lines that correspond to purchase invoices. These records are **Type 2** received invoices.
- **Purchase credit memos** – Entries of VAT report lines that correspond to corrective invoices.
- **Auto-invoices and auto-credit memos** – Entries of VAT report lines that correspond to invoices and credit memos that are automatically created when goods or services are delivered by a vendor in the European Union (EU).
- **Invoices that include equivalence charge** – Equivalence charge is a type of Spanish sales tax.
- **Invoices including different VAT% or equivalence charge percentage (EC%)** – Entries of invoices that have more than one VAT percentage or equivalence charge (EC) percentage.
