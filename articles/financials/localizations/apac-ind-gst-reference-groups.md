# Set up GST reference number groups

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Goods and Services Tax (GST) transactions are differentiated by a unique number sequence. If a different number sequence is required for the address of each warehouse or legal entity, you can create a reference number sequence group. You can then assign the reference number sequence group to the addresses.

Follow these steps to create a GST reference number sequence group and assign it to addresses.

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Sales tax** \> **India** \> **GST reference number sequence group**.
2. Select **New**.
3. Enter a name and a description.
4. On the **Details** FastTab, define number sequences for the references. The following table provides more information about each reference.

    | Source              | Reference                | Description |
    |---------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
    | Accounts receivable | Bill of supply           | The **Bill of supply** number sequence is used when customer sales that have non-GST transactions are posted. |
    | Accounts receivable | Debit/Credit note        | The **Debit/Credit note** number sequence is used when customer debit or credit sales that have GST transactions are posted. |
    | Accounts receivable | Revised invoice          | The **Revised invoice** number sequence is used when customer revised sales invoices are posted that have GST transactions and a reference to the existing invoice. |
    | Accounts receivable | Advanced receipt voucher | The **Advance receipt voucher** number sequence is used when customer advance receipt transactions that have GST transactions are posted. |
    | Accounts receivable | Advanced refund voucher  | The **Advance refund voucher** number sequence is used when customer advance refund transactions that have GST transactions are posted. |
    | Accounts receivable | GST invoice              | The **GST invoice** number sequence is used when customer sales that have GST transactions are posted. |
    | Accounts receivable | Export order             | The **Export order** number sequence is used when customs export order transactions are posted. |
    | Accounts payable    | Debit/Credit note        | The **Debit/Credit note** number sequence is used when vendor debit or credit purchases are posted that have GST transactions together with reverse charge transactions. |
    | Accounts payable    | Revised invoice          | The **Revised invoice** number sequence is used when vendor revised purchase invoices are posted that have GST transactions together with reverse charge transactions, and that have a reference to the existing invoice. |
    | Accounts payable    | Advanced payment voucher | The **Advance payment voucher** number sequence is used when vendor advance payment transactions that have GST transactions are posted. |
    | Accounts payable    | GST invoice              | The **GST invoice** number sequence is used when vendor purchases are posted that have GST transactions together with reverse charge transactions. |
