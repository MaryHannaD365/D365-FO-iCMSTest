# Intelligent recommendations

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Machine learning can help recruiters and hiring managers quickly identify top candidates for a position. It can also help prospects find the position that best suits their profile and interests. As these features are used, and feedback is provided, recommendations will improve.

> [!NOTE] 
> - The intelligent recommendation features are available only with the Comprehensive hiring add-on.
> - To enable the candidate and job recommendation features, an admin must turn on the preview options for them. In the Admin center, on the **Feature management** tab, make sure that the **Preview features** option is set to **On**. Then make sure that the individual **Candidate recommendation** and **Job recommendation** options are set to **On**.

## Candidate recommendations

Because job postings might attract hundreds of applicants, it can be difficult for recruiters and hiring managers to find the candidates whose skills and background best match the position. By analyzing the correlation between the job description and requirements, and data from the candidates' resumes and profiles, machine learning can be used to produce candidate recommendations. Candidate recommendations can help recruiters and hiring managers identify the top talent and move them to the interview stage faster. For any job, if there are more than ten candidates or prospects who have resumes or complete profiles, the candidates or prospects who most closely meet the job's requirements appear in the **Applicants to consider** section on the **Job** page.

For any recommended candidate, you can select **View candidate** on the candidate card to review the candidate's profile and take action on his or her application. You can use the ellipsis button (**...**) to open the candidate's profile on a new tab. You can also use the ellipsis button to provide feedback about the recommendation. In this way, you help fine-tune the recommendation engine and improve future recommendations. Any recommendations that you don't like are removed from the **Applicants to consider** section when you refresh the **Job** page. You can use the feedback card to indicate why you didn't find the recommendation useful.

## Job recommendations 

When a prospective employee uses the career site to apply to a job, other open positions at the organization are recommended. These recommendations are based on the prospect's past applications, and on his or her resume or candidate profile. Therefore, job recommendations help prospects quickly identify the jobs that are the best fit for them. Job recommendations are provided to prospects if more than ten jobs are posted on the career site. Prospects can open the details of a job posting from the recommendation card. They can also provide feedback about a recommendation to help improve future recommendations.
