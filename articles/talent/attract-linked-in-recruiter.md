# Sourcing with LinkedIn Recruiter
[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

LinkedIn is the world’s largest talent database and often the primary system that recruiters use to find, communicate with, and source candidates for the jobs that recruiters are looking to fill. LinkedIn Recruiter integration with Dynamics 365 for
Talent: Attract makes it easier for users to hire, and to keep the data in sync between the two systems.

> [!NOTE]
> You need the Comprehensive hiring add-on and LinkedIn Recruiter seats to be able to use LinkedIn Recruiter integration with Attract.

## Set up LinkedIn Recruiter with Attract 

Before you can use the LinkedIn Recruiter capabilities, you must configure contract-level or company-level access with your Attract instance. To complete the configuration process, you must work with the user who is an Admin on your LinkedIn Recruiter contract. Complete the following steps to configure LinkedIn Recruiter with Attract.

1.  Sign in to Attract as an Admin and go to **Admin Settings**.

2.  On the left pane, click the **LinkedIn Integration** tab.

3.  Click **Connect** to start the setup and be guided through the LinkedIn sign-in process.

4.  If you have seats on multiple LinkedIn contracts, select the contract that you would like to connect to the Attract system. If you have a seat on only one LinkedIn contract, this step will not be needed.

5.  The LinkedIn widget will now load in your Admin settings with the list of integrations shown. Under **Recruiter System connect**, click **Request**.
